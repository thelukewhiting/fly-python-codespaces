This is a simple Python project using Poetry, configured for development in GitHub Codespaces.

## Getting Started

1. Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces or locally using VS Code with the Remote - Containers extension.
2. The development container will automatically set up the Python environment with Poetry.
3. Open a terminal and run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.
4. Run `python app.py` to execute the sample script.

## Development

- Use `poetry add <package>` to add new dependencies.

Happy coding!
